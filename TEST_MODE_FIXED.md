# Test Mode - Fixed & Restored ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

The `bump-version.js` script was accidentally overwritten and had lost its test mode functionality. This has been **fully restored and verified working**.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Test Mode Working** - `--test` and `-t` flags properly recognized  
‚úÖ **Gemini API Integration** - Using `gemini-2.5-flash` model  
‚úÖ **No Unintended Changes** - Script was behaving like production, now correctly shows test mode behavior  
‚úÖ **Safe Preview** - Can now safely preview releases before running for real  

## How to Use

### Test Mode (Safe Preview)
```bash
pnpm bump-version 0.1.3 --test
# or
npm run bump-version 0.1.3 --test
# or
npm run bump-version 0.1.3 -t
```

**Output shows:**
- ‚úÖ What files would be updated
- ‚úÖ AI-generated changelog preview
- ‚úÖ What git operations would happen
- ‚ùå **No files are actually modified**
- ‚ùå **No commits are created**
- ‚ùå **No tags are pushed**

### Production Mode (Real Release)
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key pnpm bump-version 0.1.3
```

## Example Output

```
üß™ TEST MODE - Changes will NOT be committed

## Files Updated

- `scripts/bump-version.js` - Restored with test mode and Gemini integration
- `scripts/BUMP_VERSION_README.md` - Documentation (up to date)
- `scripts/TEST_MODE_GUIDE.md` - Test mode guide (up to date)  
- `GEMINI_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details (up to date)

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Create commits** on your branch
2. **Preview release** (test mode):
   ```bash
   pnpm bump-version 0.1.3 --test
   ```
3. **Review output** - Verify changelog and version look good
4. **Create release** (for real):
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key pnpm bump-version 0.1.3
   ```
5. **Verify on GitHub** - Check that tag and release were created

## Safety Guarantee

**Test mode is 100% safe:**
- No files modified
- No git commits created
- No tags created locally
- No pushes to remote
- No side effects whatsoever
- Can run unlimited times

The script will now properly distinguish between test and production modes!
